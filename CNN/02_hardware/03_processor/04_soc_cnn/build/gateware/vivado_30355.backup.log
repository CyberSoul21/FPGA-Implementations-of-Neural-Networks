These constraints will be ignored for synthesis but will be used in implementation. Impacted constraints are listed in the file [.Xil/AccQuant_cnn_propImpl.xdc].
Resolution: To avoid this warning, move constraints listed in [.Xil/AccQuant_cnn_propImpl.xdc] to another XDC file and exclude this new file from synthesis with the used_in_synthesis property (File Properties dialog in GUI) and re-run elaboration/synthesis.

WARNING: [DRC REQP-1840] RAMB18 async control check: The RAMB18E1 accQuant_cnn/save_data_1/mem_rstl_conv1_reg_1 has an input control pin accQuant_cnn/save_data_1/mem_rstl_conv1_reg_1/ENBWREN (net: accQuant_cnn/save_data_1/ren) which is driven by a register (accQuant_cnn/positionConv/counter_i/ok_reg) that has an active asychronous set or reset.
