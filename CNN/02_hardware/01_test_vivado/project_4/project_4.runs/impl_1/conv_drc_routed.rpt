2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net f1_reg/G0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin f1_reg/L3_2/O, cell f1_reg/L3_2 (in f1_reg macro). This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net f2_reg/G0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin f2_reg/L3_2/O, cell f2_reg/L3_2 (in f2_reg macro). This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net fill_image/E[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin fill_image/j_reg[1]_i_2/O, cell fill_image/j_reg[1]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#4 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net fill_image/flag0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin fill_image/f2_reg_i_1/O, cell fill_image/f2_reg_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#5 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net fill_image/full_reg_0[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin fill_image/i_reg[1]_i_2/O, cell fill_image/i_reg[1]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#6 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net register is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin register_reg[0][0][7]_i_2/O, cell register_reg[0][0][7]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#7 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net register_reg[0][1][7]_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin register_reg[0][1][7]_i_1/O, cell register_reg[0][1][7]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#8 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net register_reg[0][2][7]_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin register_reg[0][2][7]_i_1/O, cell register_reg[0][2][7]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#9 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net register_reg[1][0][7]_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin register_reg[1][0][7]_i_1/O, cell register_reg[1][0][7]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#10 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net register_reg[1][1][7]_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin register_reg[1][1][7]_i_1/O, cell register_reg[1][1][7]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
