WARNING: [Synth 8-4767] Trying to implement RAM 'mem_rstl_max_reg' in registers. Block RAM or DRAM implementation is not possible; see log for reasons.
Reason is one or more of the following :
	1: RAM has multiple writes via different ports in same process. If RAM inferencing intended, write to one port per process. 
	2: Unable to determine number of words or word size in RAM. 
	3: No valid read/write found for RAM.

ERROR: [DRC NSTD-1] Unspecified I/O Standard: 78 out of 78 logical ports use I/O standard (IOSTANDARD) value 'DEFAULT', instead of a user assigned specific value. This may cause I/O contention or incompatibility with the board power or connectivity affecting performance, signal integrity or in extreme cases cause damage to the device or the components to which it is connected. To correct this violation, specify all I/O standards. This design will fail to generate a bitstream unless all logical ports have a user specified I/O standard value defined.
